Strategic RIE Reduction Roadmap
Executive-Driven Strategy with Portfolio Aging and Process Enhancement Focus
Executive Summary: This roadmap integrates critical executive insights about portfolio aging effects, aggressive collection strategies, and policy changes driving RIE increases. Dual-track approach addresses immediate lien/title crisis while building comprehensive prevention system accounting for portfolio maturation dynamics.

Executive Strategic Insights - Root Cause Analysis
Critical Hypothesis from Leadership Discussion:
"Multiple forces are driving RIE increases despite process improvements"
Factor 1: Portfolio Aging Effect

Aging loan book naturally increases RIE risk as older loans have higher complexity
Origination strategy created concentration of loans now reaching higher-risk age brackets
Baseline expectation: RIE rates will increase even with process improvements due to portfolio maturation

Factor 2: Tier Structure and Extended Collection Strategy

Aggressive Tier 5 pursuit: Accounts at 278-337 DPD receiving intensive collection efforts
Extended delinquency cycle: Complete Tier 1-5 cycle takes 262 days (75 + 22 + 60 + 60 + 60 + 60), then 90-day wait, then restart
Multiple cycle exposure: Accounts can cycle through this process repeatedly, reaching 600+ DPD
$300M portfolio impact: Accounts that would have been charged off under previous policy now cycling through extended collection
Higher inherent risk: Accounts at 278+ DPD (Tier 5) and multiple-cycle accounts have significantly higher title/lien complexity

Factor 3: Process Improvement Gaps

Implementation incomplete: Current improvements haven't fully addressed systemic issues
VentLane limitations: 26% blank response rate indicates vendor inadequacy
Lien/Title focus needed: Biggest contributor to RIE increases alongside bankruptcy

Factor 4: Data and Categorization Issues

Category inconsistency: Year-over-year categorization changes affecting trend analysis
Reporting gaps: Need for real-time, month-to-date tracking vs. monthly summaries
Executive visibility: Leadership needs waterfall analysis showing impact of each factor


Enhanced Data Collection - Executive Requirements
Current Data Assets:

Account number, return reason, violation type, controllable flag
Manager, hub leader, vehicle return status, comments, dates

Critical Additional Data Points Based on Executive Insights:
Portfolio Aging Analysis Data:

Loan origination date (portfolio vintage analysis)
Days in delinquency at repo assignment (risk stratification)
Account age at first delinquency (maturation effect tracking)
Previous charge-off policy applicability (would this have been written off before?)
Tier assignment history (Tier 5 vs. regular collection path)

Tier Structure and Policy Impact Tracking Data:

Current tier assignment (Tier 1: 75-97 DPD, Tier 2: 98-157 DPD, Tier 3: 158-217 DPD, Tier 4: 218-277 DPD, Tier 5: 278-337 DPD)
Tier cycle history (number of complete cycles through Tier 1-5 progression)
Days in current tier (time elapsed in current tier assignment)
90-day waiting period status (accounts in holding period before reversion to Tier 1)
Total days past due at repo assignment (comprehensive delinquency timeline)
Extension history (number and duration of extensions granted)
Account balance at policy implementation ($300M portfolio tracking)
Risk category at origination (baseline risk vs. acquired risk)

Real-Time Performance Data:

Week-to-date RIE accumulation (executive dashboard requirement)
Month-to-date trending with comparative analysis
Category mix evolution (lien/title vs. bankruptcy trending)
Vintage cohort performance (loan age impact analysis)
Policy cohort performance (pre/post policy change tracking)

Vendor and Process Performance:

Blank response rate by vintage (older loans = higher blank rates?)
Manual verification success by account age (complexity correlation)
Tier 5 RIE rate vs. standard collection RIE rate (aggressive strategy cost)
Process improvement impact by vintage (which loan ages benefit most?)


Phase 1: Executive Intelligence and Crisis Response (Weeks 1-4)
Week 1: Portfolio Aging Impact Analysis
Objective: Quantify how much of RIE increase is due to portfolio aging vs. controllable factors
Critical Analysis:

Tier-based RIE analysis: RIE rates by current tier assignment (Tier 1 vs. Tier 5 vs. multiple cycles)
Delinquency progression correlation: RIE probability by total days past due (75 DPD vs. 278+ DPD vs. 600+ DPD)
Cycle impact quantification: First cycle vs. second cycle vs. third+ cycle RIE rates
Tier 5 vs. other tier RIE comparison: Specific focus on 278-337 DPD intensive collection period
90-day waiting period analysis: RIE patterns during holding periods

Executive Deliverable: Waterfall chart showing:

Baseline RIE rate for accounts at 75-97 DPD (Tier 1 baseline)
Increase due to Tier 2-4 progression (+X% for 98-277 DPD)
Increase due to Tier 5 intensive collection (+Y% for 278-337 DPD)
Increase due to multiple cycle exposure (+Z% for second/third+ cycles)
Increase due to extended DPD timeline (+A% for 600+ DPD accounts)
Decrease due to process improvements (-B%)
Net change explanation with tier-specific attribution
