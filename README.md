Current_Alloc should be the AVERAGE allocation from July 2024 - May 2025
Why Average Instead of Just July?
Because allocations probably changed month-to-month during this period. We want to compare against what actually happened on average.
Formula for Current_Alloc:
Column C (Current_Alloc): =AVERAGE(Alpha_July_Alloc:Alpha_May_Alloc)
Example:
Alpha July 2024: 23%
Alpha Aug 2024: 22%  
Alpha Sep 2024: 24%
...
Alpha May 2025: 21%

Current_Alloc = AVERAGE(23%, 22%, 24%, ..., 21%) = 22.5%
üí° Question 2: YES! Let's Add Automatic Ranking Formula
Absolutely! Let's create a formula that automatically assigns allocations based on performance rank.
üìà Updated Spreadsheet Setup
Your Column Structure Should Be:
|   L   |      M      |       N       |        O        |       P       |        Q        |        R        |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
|   1   | Avg_Success | Current_Alloc | Performance_Rank| Scenario_1    | Scenario_2      | Allocation_Logic|
|   2   | [formula]   | [formula]     | [formula]       | [formula]     | [formula]       | [description]   |
üßÆ Step-by-Step Formulas
Column L - Avg_Success (Same as before):
L2: =AVERAGE(B2:K2)
L3: =AVERAGE(B3:K3)  
L4: =AVERAGE(B4:K4)
L5: =AVERAGE(B5:K5)
Column M - Current_Alloc (Average of July-May):
M2: =AVERAGE([range of Alpha allocations July-May])
M3: =AVERAGE([range of Bravo allocations July-May])
M4: =AVERAGE([range of Charlie allocations July-May])  
M5: =AVERAGE([range of Delta allocations July-May])
Column N - Performance_Rank:
N2: =RANK(L2,$L$2:$L$5,0)
N3: =RANK(L3,$L$2:$L$5,0)
N4: =RANK(L4,$L$2:$L$5,0)
N5: =RANK(L5,$L$2:$L$5,0)
This gives: 1 = Best performer, 4 = Worst performer
Column O - Scenario_1 (+/-1% Based on Rank):
O2: =IF(N2=1,M2+1%,IF(N2=2,M2+1%,IF(N2=3,M2-1%,M2-1%)))
O3: =IF(N3=1,M3+1%,IF(N3=2,M3+1%,IF(N3=3,M3-1%,M3-1%)))
O4: =IF(N4=1,M4+1%,IF(N4=2,M4+1%,IF(N4=3,M4-1%,M4-1%)))
O5: =IF(N5=1,M5+1%,IF(N5=2,M5+1%,IF(N5=3,M5-1%,M5-1%)))
Translation:

Rank 1 (best): +1%
Rank 2 (second): +1%
Rank 3 (third): -1%
Rank 4 (worst): -1%

Column P - Scenario_2 (+/-2% Based on Rank):
P2: =IF(N2=1,M2+2%,IF(N2=2,M2+2%,IF(N2=3,M2-2%,M2-2%)))
P3: =IF(N3=1,M3+2%,IF(N3=2,M3+2%,IF(N3=3,M3-2%,M3-2%)))
P4: =IF(N4=1,M4+2%,IF(N4=2,M4+2%,IF(N4=3,M4-2%,M4-2%)))
P5: =IF(N5=1,M5+2%,IF(N5=2,M5+2%,IF(N5=3,M5-2%,M5-2%)))
Column Q - Allocation_Logic (For Documentation):
Q2: =IF(N2=1,"Top performer: +1%/+2%",IF(N2=2,"2nd place: +1%/+2%",IF(N2=3,"3rd place: -1%/-2%","Worst: -1%/-2%")))

üí° Pro Tips

Use absolute references in RANK formula (L$2:
L$5) so you can copy down

Format percentages properly so 1% shows as 1.0%, not 0.01
Add conditional formatting to highlight top/bottom performers
Test with dummy data first to make sure formulas work

‚ùì Next Steps

Set up the formulas I provided above
Test with your actual July-May data
Verify totals sum to 100%
Move to the Monthly_Projections tab once this is working

Where to Get the Success Rate Data:
Columns B-E should come from your actual monthly data for each vendor from July 2024 - May 2025.
üßÆ Step 4: Set Up the Weighted Success Formulas
Column F - Current Weighted Success:
This uses the actual allocations that were used during this period.
F3: =B3*22.5% + C3*28.3% + D3*26.1% + E3*23.1%
Copy this formula down to F13
Column G - Scenario 1 Weighted Success:
This uses your Scenario 1 allocations (¬±1% adjustments).
G3: =B3*21.5% + C3*29.3% + D3*27.1% + E3*22.1%
Copy this formula down to G13
Column H - Scenario 2 Weighted Success:
This uses your Scenario 2 allocations (¬±2% adjustments).
H3: =B3*20.5% + C3*30.3% + D3*28.1% + E3*21.1%
Copy this formula down to H13
üí° Pro Tip: Reference Your Allocation Table
Instead of typing percentages directly, reference your Scenario_Allocations tab:
G3: =B3*Scenario_Allocations!O2 + C3*Scenario_Allocations!O3 + D3*Scenario_Allocations!O4 + E3*Scenario_Allocations!O5
This way if you change allocations, the projections update automatically!
üìä Step 5: Create Summary Analysis

üìà Step 7: Create Visual Chart
Insert a Line Chart:

Select data range: A3:A13, F3:H13 (months and all three scenarios)
Insert ‚Üí Line Chart
Chart title: "Monthly Weighted Success Rates: Current vs Scenarios"
Add data labels and legend

What This Chart Shows:

Blue line: Actual performance with current allocations
Orange line: Projected performance with Scenario 1 (¬±1%)
Gray line: Projected performance with Scenario 2 (¬±2%)

You should see the scenario lines generally above the current line if your allocation strategy works!
üß™ Step 8: Statistical Significance Testing
Create a new tab called "Statistical_Tests"
Set up a simple t-test to see if improvements are statistically significant:
|   A   |        B        |       C       |        D        |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
|   1   | **T-TEST ANALYSIS** |           |                 |
|   2   |                 | Scenario_1    | Scenario_2      |
|   3   | Sample Size     | 11            | 11              |
|   4   | Mean Difference | =Monthly_Projections!C24 | =Monthly_Projections!D24 |
|   5   | Std Error       | =Monthly_Projections!C21/SQRT(11) | =Monthly_Projections!D21/SQRT(11) |
|   6   | T-Statistic     | =B4/B5        | =C4/C5          |
|   7   | P-Value (2-tail)| =T.DIST.2T(ABS(B6),10) | =T.DIST.2T(ABS(C6),10) |
|   8   | Significant?    | =IF(B7<0.05,"YES","NO") | =IF(C7<0.05,"YES","NO") |
What This Tells You:

P-Value < 0.05: The improvement is statistically significant
P-Value ‚â• 0.05: Could be due to random chance

üìä Step 9: Sensitivity Analysis
Test Different Allocation Adjustments:
Create another section in your Statistical_Tests tab:
|   A   |        B        |       C       |        D        |        E        |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
|  10   | **SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS** |     |                 |                 |
|  11   | Allocation Adj  | Success Lift  | Annual Value    | Net Benefit     |
|  12   | ¬±0.5%          | [calculate]   | [calculate]     | [calculate]     |

|  16   | ¬±2.5%          | [calculate]   | [calculate]     | [calculate]     |
This helps you find the optimal allocation adjustment level.

‚úÖ Final Quality Checklist
Before presenting, verify:

 All allocation scenarios sum to 100%
 Formulas reference correct cells
 Monthly data is accurate and complete
 Charts display correctly
 Statistical tests show meaningful results
 Business impact calculations are realistic
 Executive summary links to detailed analysis

üöÄ What You Should See
If your allocation strategy works, you should see:

Scenario lines above current performance in your chart
Positive success rate improvements (even if small)
Positive net annual benefits after costs
Statistically significant results (p-value < 0.05)

If it doesn't work:

That's still valuable information! It means current allocations are already pretty optimal.

‚ùì Next Steps

Build the Monthly_Projections tab with your actual data
Test the formulas with a few months first
Create the summary calculations
Generate the chart to visualize results
Run statistical tests to validate findings

üéØ What I Think You're Describing vs. What We're Actually Doing
What You Described (Dynamic Monthly Reallocation):
Month 1: Use average allocations
Month 2: Reallocate based on Month 1 performance  
Month 3: Reallocate based on Month 2 performance
Month 4: Reallocate based on Month 3 performance
...and so on, changing every month
What We're Actually Analyzing (Static Scenario Testing):
Scenario 1: Use the SAME improved allocations for ALL 11 months
Scenario 2: Use the SAME different improved allocations for ALL 11 months
Compare: How would these fixed scenarios have performed vs. actual?
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Which Analysis Do You Want to Do?
Both are valid, but they're completely different analyses:
Option A: Static Scenario Analysis (What I've Been Setting Up)
Question: "What if we had used better fixed allocations for the whole period?"
Method: Calculate optimal allocations once, apply to all 11 months
Pros: Simpler, more stable for vendors
Cons: Doesn't adapt month-to-month
Option B: Dynamic Reallocation Analysis (What You Just Described)
Question: "What if we reallocated every month based on previous month's performance?"
Method: Start with current allocations, then adjust month-by-month based on results
Pros: More responsive, potentially higher returns
Cons: Much more complex, operationally challenging
üìä Let Me Show You Both Approaches
Static Approach Example:
July 2024: Alpha 21.5%, Bravo 29.3%, Charlie 27.1%, Delta 22.1%
Aug 2024: Alpha 21.5%, Bravo 29.3%, Charlie 27.1%, Delta 22.1%  
Sep 2024: Alpha 21.5%, Bravo 29.3%, Charlie 27.1%, Delta 22.1%
...same allocations all 11 months
Dynamic Approach Example:
July 2024: Alpha 22.5%, Bravo 28.3%, Charlie 26.1%, Delta 23.1% (baseline)
Aug 2024: Reallocate based on July performance
Sep 2024: Reallocate based on August performance  
Oct 2024: Reallocate based on September performance
...allocations change every month
üéØ My Recommendation: Start with Static, Then Add Dynamic
Why start with static:

Easier to understand and implement
Cleaner business case for stakeholders
Proves the concept before adding complexity
Operationally realistic (vendors need predictability)

Then, if static works, add dynamic analysis as "Phase 2"
üìö Complete Guide: Static Scenario Analysis
Since I think static is the better starting point, let me give you the complete step-by-step guide for that approach:
Step 1: Calculate Baseline Allocations

In your Baseline_Performance tab:
| Vendor  | Jul | Aug | Sep | Oct | Nov | Dec | Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr | May | Average |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|---------|
| Alpha   | 23% | 22% | 24% | 21% | 23% | 22% | 24% | 22% | 21% | 23% | 22% | 22.5%   |
| Bravo   | 29% | 30% | 28% | 31% | 27% | 29% | 28% | 30% | 29% | 27% | 28% | 28.6%   |
| Charlie | 26% | 25% | 27% | 25% | 28% | 26% | 25% | 26% | 27% | 28% | 27% | 26.4%   |
| Delta   | 22% | 23% | 21% | 23% | 22% | 23% | 23% | 22% | 23% | 22% | 23% | 22.5%   |
Formula for Average column:
L2: =AVERAGE(B2:K2)
Step 2: Calculate Performance Rankings
What this means: Rank vendors by their average success rate over the 11 months
| Vendor  | Jul Success | Aug Success | ... | May Success | Avg Success | Rank |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----|-------------|-------------|------|
| Alpha   | 1.8%        | 1.6%        | ... | 1.8%        | 1.85%       | 4    |
| Bravo   | 3.4%        | 3.6%        | ... | 3.9%        | 3.57%       | 1    |
| Charlie | 2.6%        | 2.4%        | ... | 2.4%        | 2.52%       | 2    |
| Delta   | 2.2%        | 2.0%        | ... | 2.0%        | 2.16%       | 3    |
Formula for Rank column:
N2: =RANK(M2,$M$2:$M$5,0)
Step 3: Create Improved Allocation Scenarios
What this means: Based on rankings, create better allocation strategies
| Vendor  | Current Avg | Rank | Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 | Logic |
|---------|-------------|------|------------|------------|-------|
| Alpha   | 22.5%       | 4    | 21.5%      | 20.5%      | Worst: -1%/-2% |
| Bravo   | 28.6%       | 1    | 29.6%      | 30.6%      | Best: +1%/+2% |
| Charlie | 26.4%       | 2    | 27.4%      | 28.4%      | 2nd: +1%/+2% |
| Delta   | 22.5%       | 3    | 21.5%      | 20.5%      | 3rd: -1%/-2% |
| TOTAL   | 100.0%      | -    | 100.0%     | 100.0%     | Must sum to 100% |
Formulas:
Scenario 1: =IF(N2<=2, M2+1%, M2-1%)
Scenario 2: =IF(N2<=2, M2+2%, M2-2%)
Step 4: Apply Scenarios to Historical Data
What this means: Test how these fixed allocations would have performed each month
In Monthly_Projections tab:
| Month   | Alpha Success | Bravo Success | Charlie Success | Delta Success | Current Weighted | Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 |
|---------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|------------|------------|
| 2024-07 | 1.8%          | 3.4%          | 2.6%            | 2.2%          | [actual result]  | [calc]     | [calc]     |
| 2024-08 | 1.6%          | 3.6%          | 2.4%            | 2.0%          | [actual result]  | [calc]     | [calc]     |
Formulas:
Current Weighted (F3): =B3*22.5% + C3*28.6% + D3*26.4% + E3*22.5%
Scenario 1 (G3): =B3*21.5% + C3*29.6% + D3*27.4% + E3*21.5%
Scenario 2 (H3): =B3*20.5% + C3*30.6% + D3*28.4% + E3*20.5%
Step 5: Calculate the Business Impact
What this means: Show how much better the scenarios would have been
| Metric | Current | Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 |
|--------|---------|------------|------------|
| Avg Success Rate | 2.421% | 2.445% | 2.469% |
| Improvement | - | +0.024% | +0.048% |
| Annual Assignments | 48,000 | 48,000 | 48,000 |
| Extra Recoveries | - | +12 | +23 |
| Annual Value | - | +$60,000 | +$115,000 |
Step 6: Statistical Testing
What this means: Prove the improvement is real, not just luck
T-test setup:
Null hypothesis: No difference between current and scenario performance
Alternative: Scenario performs better
P-value < 0.05 = statistically significant improvement
Step 7: Cost-Benefit Analysis
What this means: Make sure the benefits outweigh implementation costs
| Cost/Benefit | Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Annual Benefit | $60,000 | $115,000 |
| Implementation Cost | $25,000 | $25,000 |
| Annual Admin Cost | $15,000 | $15,000 |
| Net Benefit | $20,000 | $75,000 |
| ROI | 50% | 188% |
üéØ If You Want Dynamic Analysis Instead...
I can absolutely walk you through that, but it's much more complex. Here's what it would involve:

Month 1: Start with current allocations
Month 2: Reallocate based on Month 1 rankings
Month 3: Reallocate based on Month 2 rankings
Repeat for all 11 months
Track cumulative performance vs. current system

This requires:

More complex formulas (dynamic allocation calculations)
Iterative calculations (each month depends on previous month)
Operational considerations (can vendors handle frequent changes?)

‚úÖ Quality Checklist
Before presenting, verify:

 All allocation totals = 100% (check Scenario_Allocations row 6)
 Success rate data is complete for all 11 months
 Formulas reference correct cells (no #REF! errors)
 Chart displays three distinct lines
 Statistical tests show P-values
 Business impact calculations are reasonable
üöÄ Expected Timeline
Day 1: Set up Baseline_Performance tab with your data Day 2: Create Scenario_Allocations tab with ranking formulas Day 3: Build Monthly_Projections tab and summary analysis
Day 4: Add statistical testing and create chart Day 5: Complete Executive Summary and quality check

üéØ What Success Looks Like
If your optimization works, you should see:

Scenario 1 improves success rate by 0.01-0.05 percentage points
Annual value impact of $25,000-$100,000
P-value < 0.05 (statistically significant)
Consistent improvement across most months
